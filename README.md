This project implements a simple console-based calculator in C++.

## Key Concepts

- **#include**: Enables referencing code located in other files. `< >` is used for the C++ Standard Library, while `" "` is used for other files.
- **using namespace std;**: Directs the compiler to expect elements from the C++ Standard Library to be used in this file, eliminating the need for `std::` before each keyword.
- **cout**: Outputs to standard output in C++.
- **endl**: Terminates the line and moves the cursor to the next line. It flushes the buffer, impacting performance, but ensures immediate output.
- **int main()**: The primary function where program execution begins and ends. All code must be accessible from here.
- **#pragma once**: A preprocessor directive ensuring header files are included only once, though not standard, it's widely supported.
- **class**: Defines a blueprint for an object's functionality in C++.
- **.h and .cpp files**: Organize C++ code into header (.h) files for declarations and source (.cpp) files for implementation details.
- **double**: Represents a data type supporting decimal numbers.
- **switch statement**: Facilitates multiple execution paths based on the value of an expression.
